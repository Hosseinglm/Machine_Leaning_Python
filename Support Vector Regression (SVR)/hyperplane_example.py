#In support vector machines(SVMs), hyperplanes are used to separate different classes of data in a binary classification problem.
#  Support Vector Regression uses the same principle as the SVMs. The basic idea behind SVR is to find the best fit line.
#  In SVR, the best fit line is the hyperplane that has the maximum number of points.
#  In both cases, the goal is to find the hyperplane that best separates the data or models the relationship,
#  and that has the largest possible margin from the nearest data points.
#Overall, hyperplanes are an important concept in machine learning, and are often used as the basis for many popular algorithms.
